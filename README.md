This program automates the calculation of Time Between Arrivals, Arrival Time, Duration of Operations, Start of Operations, End of Operations, Time in the System, Time Inactivity & Queues for a given number of ships. Inspired by my naval simulation course, it aims to simplify these calculations, which are often done manually, by taking random input values for inter-arrival times and operation durations.

Features
âœ” Automatic calculation of TBA, AT, DO, SO, EO, TS, TI & Q based on input data.
âœ” Process optimization to reduce errors and save time.
âœ” Simple and intuitive interface for quick use.

Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Consideration of the number of operators.
ðŸ”¹ Priority management in operations.
ðŸ”¹ Addition of a graphical interface for better usability.

Why This Project?
I noticed that some of my classmates struggled with these manual calculations. This program allows them to focus on analyzing results rather than performing calculations.
